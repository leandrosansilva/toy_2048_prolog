# Dmeqo

This is a naive and fom scratch implementation of the game
<a href="https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048</a> in (SWI-)Prolog.

It does not aim to be a playable game. I'm just training my programming skills
and found this game a nice challenge for this week.

And yes, my prolog code sucks, I'm still new in Logic Programming :-)

BTW, Dmeqo stands for *Dois Mil e Quarenta e Oito*, or something like that, which
means *Two Thousands Forty Eight* in Portuguese.
