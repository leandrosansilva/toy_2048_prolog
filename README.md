This is a naive and fom scratch implementation of the game
(<a href="https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048</a>) in (SWI-)Prolog.

It does not aim to be a playable game. I'm just training my programming skills
and found this game a nice challange for this week.

And yes, my prolog code sucks, I'm new in Logic Programming :-)
